Add this line right after line 310 in PropertiesPanel.jsx:

console.log('DEBUG PropertiesPanel:', { selectedElement, elementId, elementType, netMode, simulationSettings });

This will show us:
1. If selectedElement exists
2. What elementType is detected (should be 'place')
3. What netMode is set to (should be 'apn')
4. What simulationSettings contains

Then open the browser console when you select P1 and share what it prints.
