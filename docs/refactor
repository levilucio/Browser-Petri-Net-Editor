Proposed Refactoring Strategy for App.jsx
I recommend breaking down App.jsx into smaller, focused modules based on functionality:

1. Core Components
src/App.jsx
 (100-150 lines)
Main component structure and layout
State management for the overall application
Component composition
src/contexts/PetriNetContext.jsx (100-150 lines)
Create a context for the Petri net state
Provide state and actions to all components
Centralize state management
2. Feature-based Modules
src/features/canvas/CanvasManager.jsx (150-200 lines)
Canvas rendering and interaction logic
Zoom and scroll functionality
Grid and background
src/features/elements/ElementManager.jsx (150-200 lines)
Element creation, selection, and deletion
Element positioning and movement
Element property updates
src/features/arcs/ArcManager.jsx (150-200 lines)
Arc creation and connection logic
Arc rendering and positioning
Arc weight management
src/features/simulation/SimulationManager.jsx (150-200 lines)
Simulation state and controls
Transition firing logic
Animation handling
3. Utility Modules
src/utils/historyUtils.js (50-100 lines)
History management functions
Undo/redo functionality
src/utils/canvasUtils.js (50-100 lines)
Canvas utility functions
Coordinate calculations
Snapping logic
src/utils/elementUtils.js (50-100 lines)
Element utility functions
Finding and filtering elements
Element position calculations
src/hooks/usePetriNetEditor.js (100-150 lines)
Custom hook for editor functionality
Encapsulate common editor operations
Implementation Approach
Start with the Context:
Create the PetriNetContext first to centralize state
Move state and state update functions there
Extract Feature Modules:
Move related functionality to each feature module
Create custom hooks for each feature
Refine the Main App Component:
Simplify App.jsx to primarily handle layout and composition
Use context and hooks to access functionality
Update Component References:
Ensure all components use the new context and hooks
This approach will:

Keep files under 200-300 lines as per your rules
Improve code organization and maintainability
Make it easier to extend functionality
Separate concerns into logical modules
Maintain the existing functionality while improving structure
Would you like me to start implementing this refactoring approach? I can begin with creating the PetriNetContext and then work on extracting the first feature module.
