# Development Plan: Web-Based Algebraic Petri Net Editor and Simulator

## Progress Tracking
- ‚úÖ Completed
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚¨ú Not Started

## 1. Overview

This development plan outlines the implementation strategy for a web-based application to create, edit, and simulate Place/Transition (P/T) Petri Nets and Algebraic Petri Nets, as specified in the Software Specification (artifact_id: da7084fc-147f-45d0-80d9-2a8162d1e96c). The project is divided into two phases:
- **Phase 1**: Implement P/T Petri Net Editor and Simulator.
- **Phase 2**: Extend to Algebraic Petri Net Editor and Simulator, including axiomatic ADT definitions.

The application will be a single-page web app running in modern browsers, using JavaScript/React for the front end and Python/Pyodide for the backend, with XML-based storage for nets and ADTs. The plan assumes a team of 2‚Äì3 developers (front-end and back-end expertise) and a 6-month timeline, delivering a functional prototype meeting all functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Objectives
- Deliver a user-friendly, browser-based editor and simulator for P/T and algebraic Petri nets.
- Support up to 1000 places, 1000 transitions, and 1000 tokens, with a maximum of 20 tokens per place.
- Implement three simulation modes: interactive step-by-step, quick visual, and non-visual.
- Support axiomatic ADT definitions in XML, parsed but not used computationally in the prototype.
- Ensure performance (< 50ms editor actions, < 100ms P/T transitions, < 200ms algebraic transitions) and usability (learnable in < 5 minutes).
- Deploy as a static web app (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) with no server component.

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Front End**:
  - ‚úÖ **Framework**: React for component-based UI.
  - ‚úÖ **Canvas**: React-Konva for rendering places, transitions, arcs, and token animations.
  - ‚úÖ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI design.
  - ‚¨ú **Utilities**: JavaScript for event handling, drag-and-drop, and undo/redo.
- **Back End**:
  - ‚¨ú **Runtime**: Pyodide (WebAssembly) for in-browser Python execution.
  - ‚¨ú **Libraries**: `lxml` for XML parsing, Python standard library for guard/action evaluation.
- **File Handling**: 
  - ‚¨ú Browser File API for local XML file loading/saving.
- **Build Tools**: 
  - ‚úÖ Vite for bundling, testing, and development server.
- **Testing**: 
  - ‚úÖ Jest for unit tests
  - ‚¨ú Cypress for end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment**: 
  - ‚¨ú Static hosting (GitHub Pages or Netlify).

## 4. Team and Roles
- **Front-End Developer (1‚Äì2)**: Implement React components, Konva.js canvas, drag-and-drop, and UI interactions.
- **Back-End Developer (1)**: Implement Pyodide-based simulator, XML parsing, and guard/action evaluation.
- **Shared Responsibilities**: Testing, documentation, deployment, and iteration planning.
- **Assumptions**: Developers have experience with JavaScript/React, Python, and web development; no external designers or DevOps required.

## 7. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk: Pyodide Integration Challenges** (e.g., performance, library compatibility).
  - **Mitigation**: Test Pyodide early (Week 1) with `lxml` and basic guard/action evaluation; fallback to JavaScript-based parsing if needed.
- **Risk: Performance Bottlenecks** (e.g., canvas rendering, binding evaluation for large nets).
  - **Mitigation**: Profile performance in each milestone; optimize Konva.js rendering and limit binding iterations (e.g., cap at 20 tokens per place).
- **Risk: Complex Validation Logic** (e.g., type consistency, axiom syntax).
  - **Mitigation**: Implement validation incrementally, with unit tests for each rule; use `lxml` for robust XML validation.
- **Risk: Usability Issues** (e.g., learning curve > 5 minutes).
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct usability testing in Weeks 12 and 24; refine UI based on feedback, adding tooltips and clear error messages.

## 8. Resource Requirements

  - Estimated effort: ~20 hours/week per developer, ~1500 total hours over 6 months.
- **Hardware**: Standard development laptops (no special requirements).
- **Software**: Free/open-source tools (Vite, React, Konva.js, Tailwind CSS, Pyodide, Jest, Cypress).
- **Hosting**: Free static hosting (GitHub Pages or Netlify).
- **Budget**: Minimal (primarily developer time; no licensing or server costs).

## 9. Success Criteria
- **Phase 1** (Week 12):
